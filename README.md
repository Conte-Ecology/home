Conte-Ecology Organization Home
===============================

This repo will be used for project organization, style guides, instructions, and references. The majority of this information will be stored in the [wiki](https://github.com/Conte-Ecology/home/wiki).

Templates, documents or other types of files that serve these purposes can be added to the repo directly (instead of using the wiki).
